There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > lovelight

## Sub-Heading ##
  > an app designed to send love and light anywhere in the world at the touch of a button or the light of a lantern.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

## Problem ##
  > the pandemic forces us to stay apart physically, which, paired with the rigors of remote work, too often means we stay apart mentally and emotionally.

## Solution ##
  > with lovelight, no longer are the ones you love out of sight and out of mind. simply 'light a lantern' to passively communicate your caring and love through light: a lamp of your recipient's choosing will illuminate in their home in response to your lantern -- near, far, or wherever you are.

## Quote from You ##
  > because of the pandemic, i haven't seen many people i love in person in nearly a year. and because of my commitment to coding and learning to code, i don't often have time to schedule a zoom cocktail hour. sometimes i can't even do a phone call. i wanted to create a way to let these beloved people in my life know that i'm thinking of them, from a distance, without having to invest a ton of time on my end or demanding instant attention on theirs. so i imagined "lovelight," a two-piece app that enables two people to connect from anywhere in the world to share love and light in a world that lately can feel so dark and lonely.

## How to Get Started ##
  > for our demo, simply visit the lovelight site to light a lantern for scott! no additional setup is required.

## Customer Quote ##
  > my girlfriend is in a really rigorous software engineering bootcamp, so i haven't seen much of her in months! with my work and the pandemic, it's even harder to find the time. but with lovelight, we can always know that we're thinking of each other. this is what will be getting us through these last few weeks of hack reactor.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > send warmth and affection to your loved ones -- no matter where you are -- with lovelight. visit the website and experiment with the working demo: then, sign up to be the first to know when lovelight launches for all.
